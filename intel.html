  		<p class="content-name name1">Chicken</p>
  		<p class="content">The salty goodness of crisped pork belly transfers over to the leaner white meat. Toasting our panko in that same pan leads to an even more flavorful bread-crumb topping, complete with a slightly spicy, Italian-seasoned everything bagel spice addition.</p>

   		<p class="content-name name2">Beef</p>
   		<p class="content">Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are often used for steak, which can be cooked to varying degrees of doneness, while trimmings are often ground or minced, as found in most hamburgers. Beef contains protein, iron, and vitamin B12. Along with other kinds of red meat, high consumption is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and coronary heart disease, especially when processed. Beef has a high environmental impact, being a primary driver of deforestation with the highest greenhouse gas emissions of any agricultural product.</p>

  		<p class="content-name name3">Sushi</p>
  		<p class="content">Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.</p>
